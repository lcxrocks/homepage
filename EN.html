Our proposed method is segmenting the original domain of distribution into multiple bins, estimating the Shannon entropy for this discretized distribution using <a href="https://github.com/EEthinker/JVHW_Entropy_Estimators" target="_blank">JVHW estimator</a>, and finally converting the result to differential entropy. Our method outperforms the celebrated nearest neighbor method <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02208" target="_blank">LNN estimator</a> in both accuracy and time efficiency. <a href="#" onclick="na()" value="N/A"><font color="#ff0000"><u>[Download a writing sample]</u></font></a><br>&nbsp</p>

I conducted extensive experiments on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835" target="_blank">gcForest</a> (as you can see my name in acknowledgement), and worked on generative models based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09018", target="_blank">encoderForest</a>. I am also currently working on related problems as my undergraduate thesis topic.<br>&nbsp</p>

<li><p style="text-align:justify; line-height:20px"><b>Big Data Challenge, 2017 China's College Computer Competition.</b> <small>2017.7-2017.8</small><br>In this big data competition organized by China's Ministry of Education, we worked on a human-machine authentication problem: given a short segment of computer mouse track, how can we tell whether it is generated by human or by a spam robot? Specifically, based on real-life training data provided by Tencent Co. Ltd., we first completed feature extraction and selection by designing manual features and visualizing them in scatter plots. After that, we tuned XGBoost models to do the prediction. The code was implemented in PySpark in order to parallelize our program. Our final weighted F score was 0.6147, ranking 82/1222.<br>&nbsp</p>

<li><p style="text-align:justify; line-height:20px"><b>Duke University Research Independent Study.</b> <small>2016.8-2016.12</small><br>I worked with <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~tomasi/" target="_blank">Prof. Carlo Tomasi</a> to find path metrics to interpret and visualize the topology of the MNIST dataset (hand-written digits). By defining the local distance based on Earth Mover’s Distance between images and then designing global path metrics, I tried to build a graph to capture the overall structure of the dataset. We also tried Manifold Learning to embed data into a low-dimensional space. Specifically, we defined the global path metrics as: 1. max gap in the path, 2. the sum of local distances along path, 3. topological length (number of edges), 4. some hybrid definitions with norms or exponential functions. We ran adapted Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between images and subsequently used this information to build the graph. As the application, we can apply our method to Semi-supervised Learning (to match every unlabelled image with its nearest labelled peer) and Manifold Learning (to embed data into a low-dimensional space by Multi-Dimensional Scaling, etc.). <a href="#" onclick="na()" value="N/A"><font color="#ff0000"><u>[Download a writing sample]</u></font></a><br>&nbsp</p>

Specifically, we first collected data to show the spatial, time and size distribution of space debris, and then analyzed the potential benefits of three proposed space junk removal methods by Quadratic Programming and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Afterwards, we discussed how to make an economically attractive strategy to remove space debris.

I led a group of 22 students in <i>Kuang Yaming Honors School Media Center</i>.

<br>I did a one-month Quant internship at Tianfeng Securities in summer vacation 2016, due to my curiosity about the application of mathematical models and statistical methods in Finance. My job was reading research reports and evaluating the proposed models by experiments. I was focused on Investor Sentiment Index models, which strived to capture changes of the investors' sentiments (positive or negative about the stock market) by measuring the Spearman's rank correlation of some market indices (e.g. beta values and rates of return). The output of the model was a 0-1 string, indicating whether we should hold or sell the stocks. I simulated this decision-making strategy based on past data, and computed the potential profits to show how well it would work.</p>
